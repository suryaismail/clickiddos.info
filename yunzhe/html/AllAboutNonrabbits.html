    <h4>The Nonbunny</h4>

Little Nonbunny Full, Full, <br>
I want to see you right NOW<br>
scooping up the place mace <br>
and popbing them on the skull!<br>
            <br>

    <h4>The Rhyming Poem</h4>
Do no no good<br>
Loo Kang-aroo<br>
Lai chi kang-ing<br>
Stir dir lure tour<br>
            <br>

	<h4>Some Cents</h4>
Seven thousand peasants<br>
Eleven pleasant pheasants<br>
With no hoax presents<br>
Comes no true crescents<br>	
	
	<h4>Cautiousness and consequences(other names: Sea of uncertainties and unpredictability, Treasures and dangers)</h4>
Words and phrases are there for use<br>
No thoughts pre do and it goes quite loose<br>
For those who abuse and maybe accuse<br>
Shall justice be shown to those of its own?<br>

	<h5>Alternative version:</h5>
Words and phrases are there for you<br>
Use it wisely or it ought be cruel<br>
Shall retribution befall persons<br>
For they misuse, abuse or accuse?<br>
